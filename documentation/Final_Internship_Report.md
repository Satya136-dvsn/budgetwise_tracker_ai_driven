## 1. Executive Summary

BudgetWise Tracker is a state-of-the-art, AI-driven personal finance management system designed to empower individuals to take control of their financial destiny. In an era of increasing financial complexity, this platform provides a unified solution for tracking income, managing expenses, planning for retirement, and optimizing tax liabilities.

During this internship, the primary focus was to evolve the platform from a basic expense tracker into a comprehensive financial planning suite. This involved the end-to-end development of five enterprise-grade features: **Debt Management, Financial Health Analysis, Retirement Planning, Tax Planning, and Scenario Analysis.**

Key achievements include the implementation of complex financial algorithms (e.g., Avalanche debt payoff, compound interest projections), the design of a responsive and intuitive user interface using React and Material-UI, and the deployment of a robust Spring Boot backend. The system successfully integrates secure JWT authentication and real-time data processing, offering users actionable insights into their financial well-being.

## 2. Introduction

### 2.1 Problem Statement

Financial illiteracy and lack of proper tools are major barriers to personal economic stability. Many individuals struggle with:

- Fragmented financial data across multiple bank accounts.
- Inability to visualize long-term impacts of current spending.
- Lack of knowledge regarding debt payoff strategies and tax optimization.
- Difficulty in planning for major life goals like retirement.

### 2.2 Proposed Solution

BudgetWise Tracker addresses these challenges by offering a centralized dashboard that aggregates financial data and applies intelligent algorithms to provide personalized recommendations. It moves beyond simple tracking to predictive analysis, helping users answer "What if?" questions about their finances.

### 2.3 Objectives

- **Centralization:** To bring all financial data (budgets, debts, savings) into one view.
- **Intelligence:** To provide algorithmic recommendations for debt payoff and tax savings.
- **Usability:** To create an interface that is accessible to users with varying levels of financial and technical literacy.
- **Security:** To ensure the absolute privacy and integrity of sensitive financial data.

## 8. Implementation Details

### 8.1 Core Modules

The application is structured into modular components.

- **Auth Module:** Handles registration and login.
- **Dashboard Module:** Aggregates data for the home screen.
- **Transaction Module:** CRUD operations for daily finances.

### 8.2 Advanced Algorithms

#### Debt Payoff (Avalanche Method)

The system sorts debts by interest rate (descending). It allocates the minimum payment to all debts and directs any extra funds to the highest-interest debt. This minimizes total interest paid.

```java
// Pseudo-code for Avalanche Strategy
List<Debt> debts = debtRepository.findAll();
debts.sort((d1, d2) -> d2.getInterestRate().compareTo(d1.getInterestRate()));

while (totalDebt > 0) {
    // Pay minimums
    // Apply extra to debts[0]
    // Recalculate balances
}
```

#### Financial Health Scoring

A weighted algorithm assesses user health.

- **Debt-to-Income (40% weight):** Lower is better.
- **Savings Rate (30% weight):** Higher is better.
- **Emergency Fund (20% weight):** 6 months is ideal.
- **Budget Adherence (10% weight):** Staying within limits.

## 11. Challenges & Solutions

1. **Challenge:** Implementing the Debt Payoff Algorithm was complex due to varying interest rates and monthly compounding.
    - **Solution:** Broke down the problem into a month-by-month simulation loop, verifying each step against Excel calculations.

2. **Challenge:** Frontend-Backend API mismatches caused 500 errors.
    - **Solution:** Implemented strict DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) and used Swagger documentation to ensure contract alignment.

3. **Challenge:** Real-time updates for the Scenario Analysis sliders caused performance lag.
    - **Solution:** Implemented debouncing on the sliders to reduce the number of API calls.
